# User Interface for Interactive Virtual Soundscapes

A user interface for interactive virtual soundscapes.

## Installation

Install `node.js` package dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the server:
```bash
node .
```

The server will start, with a default port of **9877**. For now, this is hard-coded into the server script.

Go to `localhost:9877` to run the main application script. Right now it's nothing, really.

## Interactions

### Add object: 
Press the `o` key

### Move head: 
`w a s d`
