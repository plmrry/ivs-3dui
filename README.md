# User Interface for Interactive Virtual Soundscapes

A user interface for interactive virtual soundscapes.

## Installation

Install `node.js` package dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the server:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start, with a default port of **9877**. For now, this is hard-coded into the server script.

Go to `localhost:9877` to run the main application script. Right now it's nothing, really.

## Development

Point your browser at `localhost:9877/development/` to see a listing of development files and directories.
